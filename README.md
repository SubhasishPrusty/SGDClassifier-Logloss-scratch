# Log-SGDClassifier-scratch
SGDClassifier with log-loss from scratch using Numpy
This project is on understanding SGDclassifier on our own by creating our own model from scratch using Numpy and carrying out the same functions as SGDClassifier and then comparing the final weight vector of the sklearn model and our model.
We are also plotting the loss for each epoch and understanding how our optimization works.
